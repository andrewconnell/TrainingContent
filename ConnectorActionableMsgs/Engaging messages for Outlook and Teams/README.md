# Microsoft Learn Training Module - Create engaging messages with Adaptive Cards

Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI, authored in JSON, that apps and services can openly exchange. When delivered to a specific app, the JSON is transformed into native UI that automatically adapts to its surroundings. It helps design and integrate light-weight UI for all major platforms and frameworks. In this module, you’ll learn how to create engaging messages with Adaptive Cards to create Outlook Actionable Messages and conversations in Microsoft Teams.
